The bin directory holds our executable file. This file is responsible for running the program. It contains code that actually enacts the command line interaction––i.e. greeting the user, asking the user for input, storing that input and then acting on it.

Environment is responsible for things like file requirements (i.e. making sure your different files have access to one another), establishing connections to your database (if you have one) and ensuring that your test suite has access to the files that contain the code it is testing.
