# HPQuiz - The Sorting Terminal Quiz

‚ú®‚ú®Welcome!‚ú®‚ú®
\nHave you ever played the Sorting Hat quiz?
\nYes?
\nNo?
\nRegardless, you'll be able to experience that with
a Harry Potter Sorting Hat terminal version!
\nü¶Å ‚ú® ü¶Ö ‚ú® üêø ‚ú® üêç
\nYou'll not only be sorted to your house but have many options to learn about your house. Those sources will be presented on your terminal through
the power of Nokogiri, Ruby, Pottermore, and moi.

To experiment with that code, run `./bin/run` for an interactive prompt.

Have fun!~
